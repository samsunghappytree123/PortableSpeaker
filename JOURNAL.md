# June 10: Research, CAD Design
Today, too, I watched baseball. My baseball team ('Samsung Lions') won against team 'KIA Tigers'. With a score 8:0. This is very big event to me, So I want to cheer (although I watched in my home) with baseball cheersong.

The introduction was long. When I researching, I found the release of the ball-shaped, and baseball-shaped portable speaker. (But I don't know,, lol.)

I think what traits are most necessary? My answer is "loudness of sound." Baseball stadium is too loudly, so, if speaker sound is less, sound weren't listened to users.

I found 4 Unit type. However, I was able to narrow it down to two types. 

One is "Full-range driver", which can easy to design pcbs. And this can get off performance of low notes and high notes. But It's not important to my speaker.

The other type is "Unit placement for 360-degree sound". But It's too bulky to carry around. Baseball stadium is dangerous (due to the foul ball's hit), so I want to make it with something cheaper.

So, I decided to use "Full-range driver".

Here are a few models I found.

```
Aurasound NSW1-205-8A 1" Extended Range
Aurasound NSW2-326-8AT 2" Titanium Full Range
Fostex FE103NV2 4" Paper Cone Full Range
```

I haven't decided on the exact size yet, but I think I'll be able to figure out the size once I get the PCB outlined.

Unless something unexpected happens, I would probably use the first or second item mentioned above. It's small in size and looks like a speaker unit that's very suitable for a ball model.
