# June 10: Research, CAD Design
Today, too, I watched baseball. My baseball team ('Samsung Lions') won against team 'KIA Tigers'. With a score 8:0. This is very big event to me, So I want to cheer (although I watched in my home) with baseball cheersong.

The introduction was long. When I researching, I found the release of the ball-shaped, and baseball-shaped portable speaker. (But I don't know,, lol.)

I think what traits are most necessary? My answer is "loudness of sound." Baseball stadium is too loudly, so, if speaker sound is less, sound weren't listened to users.
