# PortableSpeaker

## Reason for starting the project
I like watching baseball game at the baseball stadium.

When the game ended and my team is win, my team fans will hold on the after party.

So, when after party, I want to play my team cheer songs to cheer teams and players in my baseball stadium square. With My Speakers.

Since the afterparty is guerrilla-style, it would be a shame if you didn't prepare speakers separately (although that would be fun in its own right).
